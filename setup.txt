#playlist delimiter is: \
 Used this over a comma , etc because of comma's being in song titles. Save the file in UTF-8 format.

Modify runme.py change the playlist filename to whatever you file name is.

#Purpose
#Modified Tom's script to read a file export of a Rhapsody sqlite3 database
#and then used the file to create playlists in Google Music.

#Modifieds script to Parse a file in the format::
#[Playlist]\[Artist]\[Album]\[Title]

# Quick Notes
# Using the directions for Rhapsody found here: 
# url:http://www.cutdek.com/blog/2011/6/23/exporting-your-rhapsody-library-to-csv.html
# Navicat Light works awesome for this, run query, choose export to text file, choose Other Symbol for delimiter and set to: \
# Modify the runme.py with your google music username and password (will not work unless you have a subscription)
#install gmusicapi with pip

# I wrote this quickly and didnt take the time reorganize the code.
# you may need to play with the song_compare subs to do a better job of find the correct song in all access.
